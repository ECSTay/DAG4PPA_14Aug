# DAG4PPA_14Aug
These are the latest markdowns for the AVS causal modelling simulation study. 

The first block in each markdown is the code for the data generative model which is based on DAG4. The 12 scenarios vary in prevalence of mod-severe vaccine reactions, survey participation and relative discrepancy in survey participation between severe and mild reactions (Ï„_sp).

The Bayesian statistical model is applied to the 12 different scenarios and the posterior probabilities with mean estimates and sds are collected.

The AVS PPA signal detection method is applied to the data generated under the 12 different scenarios, using the LLL scenario as Week 1.

Also includeed is code for the prior predicticve check for the DAG4 model.
